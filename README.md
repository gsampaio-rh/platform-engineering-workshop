# Platform Engineering Workshop

This workshop is designed for anyone looking to enhance their skills in product design and the development of internal development platforms, while understanding the critical dynamics of effective team collaboration. Participants will be immersed in activities ranging from deep customer needs discovery to user journey mapping and the development of strategic product roadmaps. Through practical and collaborative techniques such as 'Design the Box', 'Event Storming', and 'User Story Mapping', participants will learn to effectively apply concepts in the design of internal products.

Furthermore, the workshop will incorporate essential elements of Team Topologies, emphasizing the importance of effective team structuring and inter-functional collaboration. Participants will explore how different team configurations can impact product development and solution delivery, enhancing their understanding of how to create teams aligned with business needs and design requirements.

## üìò What is Docsify?

Docsify is a lightweight tool designed for creating beautiful documentation websites directly from Markdown files. Unlike some static site generators, Docsify doesn't require the pre-compilation of your Markdown into HTML. Instead, it dynamically renders your site's content on the fly as the page loads, offering speed and agility in documentation delivery. With its support for a wide range of plugins and themes, Docsify provides a flexible and straightforward approach to crafting interactive and user-friendly documentation.

### üîç Prerequisites

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system, as it comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which is essential for installing Docsify.

### Installing Docsify CLI

1. To install the Docsify CLI, if you haven't already, use npm with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g docsify-cli
    ```

2. To serve your documentation, execute:

    ```bash
    docsify serve docs
    ```

    This command launches a local server, typically accessible at <http://localhost:3000>. Visit this URL in your web browser to view your documentation live.

3. Accessing Your Live Documentation

**With the Docsify server running as instructed above, your live documentation is available by navigating to the provided local URL (usually <http://localhost:3000>).**

### üõ†Ô∏è Tips

Refresh your browser to view updated content anytime you make changes to the documentation files.

Customize the look and functionality of your Docsify site by modifying the index.html file located at the root of your documentation directory. Docsify offers numerous customization options to enhance your documentation experience.

### üìú Configurations and Customizations:

For specific settings, customizations, or to incorporate plugins, themes, etc., you can do so by editing the index.html file at the root of your documentation directory.

üß† Remember, Docsify dynamically loads content, eliminating the need for recompilation or rebuilding with each change. A simple browser refresh is all it takes!
