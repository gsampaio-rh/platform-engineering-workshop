I am creating Markdown files to organize my thoughts and notes around a theme. The objective here is that the content represents the concepts I learned, but it doesn't feel AI-written or copy-paste.

The document is structured as an informative guide, presenting an in-depth exploration of the subject. It's designed to educate readers on the significance, practices, and impacts of subject. Key characteristics include:

Hierarchical Organization: The document is methodically structured with a main title, sections, and subsections. This hierarchical organization facilitates easy navigation and understanding of the content, allowing readers to grasp the concept of the subject and its components systematically.

Thematic Segmentation: The content is segmented into distinct themes, each addressing different facets of the subject, from its definition and importance to the tools and frameworks used to enhance developer productivity. This thematic approach helps in compartmentalizing information for better comprehension.

Incorporation of Visuals: It includes visuals (e.g., diagrams and tables) to illustrate complex concepts and metrics, aiding in the reader's understanding. The visuals serve as a complementary medium of information, making abstract ideas more tangible.

Use of External References: The document employs external references and links to studies, reports, and additional resources. These references not only lend credibility to the information presented but also offer readers avenues for further exploration of the topics discussed.

Case Studies and Examples: It includes case studies and examples. These real-world applications of the subject practices provide practical insights and underline the relevance of the subject.

Frameworks and Metrics: The document outlines specific frameworks and metrics used to assess and improve the theme. This section offers concrete tools and methodologies for organizations looking to implement the subject practices.

Actionable Insights: Throughout the document, actionable insights and recommendations are provided. T

The markdown document employs a structured format to present information clearly and concisely, using markdown syntax to enhance readability and navigation. Here's an overview of its structure and markdown elements used:

Titles and Headings: The document uses a hierarchy of headings to organize content, starting with a primary title indicated by a single hashtag (#) for the main topic, followed by secondary headings for major sections (##), and further subsections (###). This hierarchy helps structure the content logically and emphasizes the importance of each section.

Bulleted and Numbered Lists: To enumerate key points, components, and steps, the document makes use of both bulleted (-) and numbered lists (1., 2., 3., etc.). These lists break down information into digestible pieces, making it easier for readers to follow and understand the content.

Links: External references and further readings are incorporated as hyperlinks ([link text](URL)), allowing readers to access additional information seamlessly. This enriches the document by providing resources for in-depth exploration of topics discussed.

Images: Visuals are integrated using the markdown syntax for images (![Alt text](URL)), complementing the textual content with diagrams, charts, and mock-ups. These visuals aid in explaining complex concepts and metrics, enhancing overall comprehension.

Emphasis: Italic (*text* or _text_) and bold (**text** or __text__) formatting options are used to emphasize specific terms, phrases, or important points, drawing the reader's attention to them.

Blockquotes: The document uses blockquotes (>) to highlight quotes, research findings, or to differentiate cited information from the main body of text, providing a visual cue to readers about the significance of these excerpts.

Horizontal Rules: Horizontal lines (---) are occasionally used to separate sections or thematic breaks, providing a visual distinction between different topics or shifts in subject matter.

Footnotes and Annotations: While not explicitly shown in the brief summary, markdown documents can include footnotes and annotations to add supplementary information or clarifications without cluttering the main content.

By leveraging markdown syntax, the document achieves a clean, organized, and accessible presentation of information, facilitating an engaging and informative reading experience for the audience.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHESS:
THE NEW COMPLEXITIES OF COMPETITION
IN THE WORLD OF PLATFORMS

THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHESS:
THE NEW COMPLEXITIES OF COMPETITION
IN THE WORLD OF PLATFORMS
Enter platforms. Many of the insights embodied in the five forces, resource-based, and
hypercompetition models remain valid, but two new realities are now shaking up the world of
strategy.
First, firms that understand how platforms work can now intentionally manipulate network effects
to remake markets, not just respond to them. The implicit assumption in traditional business strategy
that competition is a zero-sum game is far less applicable in the world of platforms. Rather than redividing a pie of more-or-less static size, platform businesses often grow the pie (as, for example,
Amazon has done by innovating new models, such as self-publishing and publishing on demand,
within the traditional book industry) or create an alternative pie that taps new markets and sources of
supply (as Airbnb and Uber have done alongside the traditional hotel and taxi industries). Actively
managing network effects changes the shape of markets rather than taking them as fixed.
Second, platforms turn businesses inside out, moving managerial influence from inside to outside
the firm’s boundaries. Thus, a firm no longer needs to seize every new opportunity on its own; instead,
it can pursue only the best opportunities while helping ecosystem partners seize the others, with all
partners sharing the value they jointly create.13
These two new realities add a dramatic layer of complexity to business competition. Platform
strategy resembles traditional strategy much the way three-dimensional chess resembles the
traditional game.14 Within the ecosystem, the lead firm negotiates dynamic tradeoffs involving
competition at three levels: platform against platform, platform against partner, and partner against
partner.
At the first level, one platform competes with another, as in the video game console battles among
Sony (PlayStation), Microsoft (Xbox), and Nintendo (Wii). Strategic advantage is based not on the
attractiveness of particular products or services but rather on the power of entire ecosystems. The
Sony PlayStation Portable was a stronger gaming device than the iPhone, which lacked specialized left
and right controls. When Sony released the PSP-2000 in fall of 2007, after Apple’s summer release of
the iPhone, Sony’s stock rose about 10 percent. But before long, the iPhone ecosystem vastly
outstripped that of the PSP. As we’ve already noted, Apple has subsequently enjoyed far great
financial success than Sony, thanks in large part to the size and value of its ecosystem.
At the second level, a platform competes with its partners—for example, when Microsoft
appropriates such partner innovations as browsers, multithreading, streaming media, and instant
messaging and incorporates them into its operating system, or when Amazon operates as a platform
for independent merchants while also selling some of the same goods on the same platform in
competition with those merchants. This is a delicate and dangerous move. It can strengthen the
platform, but at the expense of weakening partners—a short-term gain that can lead to painful longterm consequences.
At the third level, two unrelated platform partners compete for positions within the platform
ecosystem, as when two game app developers strive to attract the same consumers on the same
console.15
Let’s consider some of the specific impacts that these platform-driven changes have on traditional
views of strategy.
As we’ve seen, platforms expand the boundaries of the firm. The shifting horizons of managerial
influence now make competition less significant for strategists than collaboration and co-creation—or, as scholars Barry J. Nalebuff, Adam M. Brandenburger, and Agus Maulana call it, “co-opetition.” 16
The shift from protecting value inside the firm to creating value outside the firm means that the
crucial factor is no longer ownership but opportunity, while the chief tool is no longer dictation but
persuasion.
The five forces model depends on the distinct boundaries that characterize traditional product
markets. Each of the five forces—customer power, supplier power, and so on—is a separate entity that
must be managed independently. By contrast, in platform markets, a winning strategy blurs the
boundaries among market participants, thereby increasing valuable interactions on the platform. A
Skillshare student today can become a teacher tomorrow; an Etsy customer one day can begin selling
her own crafts on the site the next. Platform competition requires treating buyers and suppliers not as
separate threats to be subjugated but as value-creating partners to be wooed, celebrated, and
encouraged to play multiple roles.
The resource-based view assumes that a firm must own, or at least control, the inimitable resource.
In the world of platforms, the nature of the inimitable resource shifts from physical assets to access to
customer–producer networks and the interactions that result. In fact, it can be better for the firm not to
own physical resources, since eschewing ownership enables it to grow more quickly. As the examples
of Airbnb and Uber remind us, the resource pool that a platform company can access is capable of
growing much faster than the platform company itself.

Winning in the platform economy – How platforms change competition

Platform disruption: Transforming industries

The game-changing phenomenon of network effects






How do some companies solve the challenge of attracting producers and consumers to a new platform simultaneously, while
others fail miserably? Why is free pricing sometimes a brilliant business move, and sometimes a fatal error? (See chapters 5
and 6.)

• Why do competitive markets flourish in some platform arenas, while in others winner-take-all markets dominated by a single
platform swiftly emerge? (See chapter 10.)

• As platforms grow, they are subject to abuse: customers shopping on eBay can be defrauded, women seeking dates on
Match.com can be assaulted, homes rented on Airbnb can be ransacked. Who should pay the price? And how should platform
users be protected? (See chapters 8 and 11.)



FOUR KINDS OF NETWORK EFFECTS
A two-sided network (i.e., one with both producers and consumers) has four kinds of network effects.
It’s important to understand and consider all four when designing and managing a platform.
In a two-sided market, same-side effects are network effects created by the impact of users from
one side of the market on other users from the same side of the market—the effects that consumers
have on other consumers and those that producers have on other producers. By contrast, cross-side
effects are network effects created by the impact of users from one side of the market on users from
the other side of the market—the effects that consumers have on producers and those that producers
have on consumers. Both same-side effects and cross-side effects can be positive or negative,
depending on the design of the system and the rules put in place. Here’s how these four types of
network effects work.
The first category, positive same-side effects, includes the positive benefits received by users when
the number of users of the same kind increases—for example, the effect that arose as the number of
subscribers to the Bell Telephone network grew. The more of your friends and neighbors who were
accessible on “the Bell,” the greater the value you received from your Bell membership. Today, a
comparable positive effect on the consumer-to-consumer side can be seen with a gaming platform like
the Xbox MMOG: the more fellow gamers you encounter on the platform, the greater the fun you
experience when using it.
Positive same-side effects can also be found on the producer side. For example, consider Adobe’s
all-but-universal image production and sharing platform. The more people who are creating and
sharing images using the PDF platform, the greater the benefit you get from using the same platform
for your own image production needs.
However, not all same-side effects are positive. Sometimes there is a downside to the numbers
growth on one side of a platform. This is called a negative same-side effect. For example, consider the
information technology platform Covisint, which connects businesses that are interested in developing
cloud-based networking tools with service providers. As the number of competing suppliers on the
Covisint platform grows, customers are attracted to the platform, which makes the suppliers happy.
But when the list of suppliers grows too great, it becomes more difficult for appropriate providers and
customers to find one another.
Cross-side effects arise when either consumers or producers gain or lose based on the number of
users on the opposite side of the platform. Positive cross-side effects occur when users benefit from an
increase in the number of participants on the other side of the market. Think about a payment
mechanism like Visa: when more merchants (producers) agree to accept the Visa card, the flexibility
and convenience of the shopping experience increases for shoppers (consumers), creating a positive
cross-side effect. The same effect works in the opposite direction, of course; more Visa cardholders
lead to more potential customers for merchants. In a similar way, when the number of app developers
for Windows grows, the versatility and power of the operating system increases for users; and when
the number of Windows users grows, so do the potential benefits (financial and otherwise) for app
developers. Positive cross-side effects produce win-win results.
Of course, cross-side effects are not necessarily symmetrical. On OkCupid, women attract men
more than men attract women. On Uber, a single driver is more critical to growth than a single rider.
On Android, a single developer’s app attracts users more than a single user attracts developer apps. On
Twitter, the vast majority of people read, while a minority tweet. On question-and-answer networks
like Quora, the vast majority asks questions, while a minority answers them.15
Again, however, there is the dark side to consider—the situation in which negative cross-side
effects arise. Think about a platform that facilitates the sharing of digital media—music, text, images,
videos, and the like. In most circumstances, a growing number of producers (music companies, for
example) leads to positive benefits for consumers, but it can also lead to growing complexity and
expense—for example, too many varying digital rights management forms to read and accept. When
this happens, the cross-side effects flip from positive to negative, leading consumers to abandon the
platform or at least reduce their usage. In a similar way, when the proliferation of messages from
competing merchants on a platform site leads to unpleasant advertising clutter, the positive impact of
expanding producer choice may be transformed into a negative cross-side effect that turns off
consumers and damages the platform’s value.
We can foresee the arrival of growing pains at Uber as a result of increasing negative cross-side
effects. If Uber attracts too many drivers relative to the number of riders, driver downtimes will go
up; if Uber attracts too many riders relative to drivers, rider wait times will go up (see Figure 2.2, in
which the resulting feedback loops have been inserted).
FIGURE 2.2. David Sacks’s napkin sketch of Uber, with negative feedback loops inserted.
In fact, this is happening already. As Uber reaches saturation within a given market, too many
drivers conflict with one another, increasing downtimes and causing some drivers to abandon the
market. The more complete depiction of Uber’s growth spiral in Figure 2.2 highlights the fact that a
firm in a two-sided market must manage all four network effects. Good platform husbandry seeks to
reinforce positive network effects, creating and strengthening as many positive feedback loops as
possible. This is another topic we’ll return to in later chapters, where we’ll offer specific advice about
how to manage these challenges effectively.
