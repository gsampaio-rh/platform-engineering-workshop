## Topics

**Topic 1: Why Do We Need a Platform? What is a Platform?**

This session explores the critical role of platforms in modern business, emphasizing their importance in promoting innovation and agility. We'll discuss how platforms, through modularity, enable flexibility and rapid development, contrasting with interdependent systems that ensure integration and efficiency. The conversation will cover the significance of aggregators in creating unified interfaces for diverse services, thereby enhancing value and user experience. By defining platforms and their ecosystems, we aim to illustrate platforms as foundational elements that support the delivery of new products and services, guided by a set of principles outlined in the "Platform Manifesto."

**Topic 2: How Do We Identify Platform Opportunities?**

In this part, we focus on uncovering platform opportunities by examining strategies to attract users, facilitate interactions, and connect users within a platform ecosystem. Highlighting the disruptive nature of platforms, we'll discuss their ability to transform businesses by detaching the value of assets from their ownership, aggregating markets, and introducing digital intermediaries. By identifying signs of an industry ready for a platform revolution, participants will learn how digital transformation shifts business models from linear to dynamic platforms, fostering ecosystems driven by platform models.

**Topic 3: Navigating Complexity and Streamlining Value Streams with Team Topologies**

In this section, we delve into managing organizational complexity and optimizing cognitive load through strategic team configurations and value stream analysis. Emphasizing the challenges presented by complex systems in modern businesses, we explore how they can significantly impact team effectiveness and cognitive burden. By employing Team Topologies' principles, we aim to structure teams in a manner that not only mitigates complexity but also accelerates the delivery of value. This part of the workshop focuses on understanding the various team structures—such as stream-aligned, enabling, complicated subsystem, and platform teams—and how they contribute to reducing bottlenecks and streamlining processes. We'll examine the concept of value streams, guiding participants through methods to identify and optimize the flow from idea inception to value delivery to the customer. Through this approach, we highlight how organizations can transform their structures to be more adaptive and efficient, ultimately fostering an environment where teams are empowered to deliver innovative solutions that meet evolving market needs.

**Topic 4: Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE)**

In this segment, we shift our focus to Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE), a discipline dedicated to maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of development teams. DPE emphasizes the use of data-driven approaches and tools to identify bottlenecks and challenges within the software development lifecycle, aiming to streamline workflows and reduce friction points. We'll explore key strategies for improving developer productivity, including the implementation of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, automation of repetitive tasks, and the establishment of clear metrics for measuring developer performance. Additionally, this part will cover the importance of fostering a culture that values learning and continuous improvement, encouraging developers to adopt practices that enhance their productivity. By understanding and applying principles of DPE, participants will learn how to create an environment that not only accelerates development processes but also promotes innovation and collaboration within their teams.
