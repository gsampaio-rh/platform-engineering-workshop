## Activity - SPACE Planning

### Ranking SPACE Categories for DPE Focus

- **SPACE Category Ranking:**
  - **Objective:** Rank the SPACE framework categories (Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication and Collaboration, Efficiency and Flow) in order of priority for your organization's Developer Productivity Engineering initiatives. This activity aims to identify which aspects of developer experience and productivity should receive the most attention and resources.
  - **Instructions:**
    1. Briefly review the five SPACE framework categories:
       - **Satisfaction:** Refers to developer well-being and satisfaction.
       - **Performance:** The efficiency and effectiveness of developers in their tasks.
       - **Activity:** The level of engagement and activity of developers.
       - **Communication and Collaboration:** The effectiveness of communication and collaboration within teams.
       - **Efficiency and Flow:** The ability to work efficiently and achieve a state of flow.
    2. As a group, discuss the current state of each SPACE category within your organization. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
    3. Individually or as a group, rank the SPACE categories from 1 to 5, where 1 is the highest priority for improvement and 5 is the lowest. Consider factors such as the current impact on developer productivity, potential for improvement, and alignment with organizational goals.
    4. Share and compare the rankings. Discuss the rationale behind the prioritization, focusing on how improving each category could enhance overall developer productivity and satisfaction.
    5. Reach a consensus on the final ranking of the SPACE categories. This consensus will guide the prioritization of DPE initiatives in your organization.

### HMW Questions for SPACE Categories

- **Objective:** Generate "How Might We" (HMW) questions for each SPACE framework category to identify innovative solutions for enhancing developer productivity and experience. This creative exercise encourages participants to think deeply about potential improvements and innovations within Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication and Collaboration, and Efficiency and Flow.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Split participants into five groups, with each group assigned to one of the SPACE framework categories:
     - **Satisfaction:** Developer well-being and satisfaction.
     - **Performance:** Efficiency and effectiveness in tasks.
     - **Activity:** Level of engagement and activity.
     - **Communication and Collaboration:** Effectiveness within teams.
     - **Efficiency and Flow:** Ability to work efficiently and achieve flow.
  2. Each group reviews their assigned category and discusses current challenges, strengths, and areas for potential improvement within the context of your organization.
  3. Using the insights from the discussion, each group generates a series of HMW questions aimed at addressing the identified challenges and opportunities within their category. Aim for broad, open-ended questions that encourage creative thinking. Examples include:
     - **Satisfaction:**
       - HMW create a more inclusive work environment to support developer well-being?
       - HMW design a real-time feedback system to reflect developer satisfaction accurately?
       - HMW implement flexible work policies that enhance personal well-being without sacrificing productivity?
     - **Performance:**
       - HMW optimize our development tools to reduce build and deployment times significantly?
       - HMW use AI to automate repetitive tasks, freeing developers for more creative work?
       - HMW foster a culture of continuous learning to enhance developer skills and efficiency?
     - **Activity:**
       - HMW gamify the development process to increase engagement and motivation?
       - HMW create a more transparent task management system that aligns with organizational goals?
       - HMW use analytics to identify productivity blockers in real-time?
     - **Communication and Collaboration:**
       - HMW enhance team collaboration tools to bridge the gap between remote and in-office teams?
       - HMW create virtual brainstorming spaces that replicate the benefits of in-person sessions?
       - HMW foster a culture of open communication to encourage idea sharing and collaborative problem-solving?
     - **Efficiency and Flow:**
       - HMW redesign our development workflow to minimize interruptions and maximize focus time?
       - HMW streamline our pipeline to minimize context switching and maximize productive coding time?
       - HMW create a health metrics system to proactively identify and suggest optimizations for workflow inefficiencies?
  4. Groups share their HMW questions with all participants. Encourage cross-group feedback to refine and expand upon the questions.
  5. For each category, prioritize the HMW questions based on their potential impact on developer productivity and experience, and the feasibility of addressing them.
  6. As a larger group, select the top HMW questions from each category for a future deep dive or ideation session aimed at developing actionable solutions.
